# Goal of the project:
We are living in a critical era as the number of the new COVID_19 cases and death due to this lethal virus is increasing worldwide and in the US. Now COVID-19 is the third cause of death in the US. Mask wearing is recommended as a preventative measures to subside the spread of this virus. However, sixteen states have very limited mask wearing requirements and one state (South Dacota) has absolutely no requirement. In this project I am trying to evaluate the effect of mask policy on COVID-19 cases. To do so I will focus on the data from two neighbor states (Georgia and Alabama) with different policies to minimize the effect of other factors (e.g. weather, demographics).
